# The CREACTIVE Working Guide

*Or Pietro’s tools, frameworks and practices to create **any** type of **media** **efficiently** and **effectively**.* Why Cre-Active? **Creative \+ Active** \= Give enough space to your creative process, but avoid analysis-paralysis. This guide will provide you with beginner and expert tools to bring on your work.

## What’s covered in this guide:

You’re probably in charge of creating one of the following products:

- a Report, a Paper, or an Article;  
- a Presentation Deck;  
- an informal text document;  
- an arbitrary informative graphic;

I’ll structure this guide by writing a chapter for each of those points, following the order above.

## Formal Documents

My go-to app for writing *Docs, Reports and Articles* that look good to everyone (zoomers to boomers) is [overleaf.com](http://overleaf.com). Specifically, I have found myself returning to:

- the [IEEE Conference Template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gmrxbjvvqzvg#823f60), a two-column IEEE-style document with authors, sections and bibliographic information;  
- [carruc’s Book Template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tgkxwpzmtbbh#b3559f) (credits to Yoshua Bengio and Mattia Puddu), which is pretty self-explanatory. Requires additional setup time if you want different styles for the main components, but helps a lot in applying *divide-et-impera* principles to writing. There are different .tex files for styles, fonts, images, and chapters \- making everything super tidy.  
- [carruc’s CS Resume Template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gpsjscxjvpxc#94bdd1) for your applications\!

Remember, if you’re lazy and don’t know how to do something on LaTeX, ask Claude/Perplexity/etc.

## Pitch Decks

Unfortunately, PowerPoint. One of the few too-good-to-ignore Microsoft apps.

My simple guide is:

1. Choose a **chunky** **font** for your **titles** and a *sleek* *font* for *everything* else; both Sans Serif (they just look better on normal PPTs). My go-tos are same **Grotesque** font for the former and a *Neo Grotesque* font for the latter. Example: [**Unbounded**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Unbounded) \+ [Inter Tight](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter+Tight?query=inter)  
   Sources for OPEN fonts: [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/awwwards/collections/free-fonts/), [Best Free Fonts](https://bestfreefonts.com/), [Open Foundry](https://open-foundry.com/fonts), [Use\&Modify](https://usemodify.com/), [open source typefaces collection](https://www.are.na/frederic-brodbeck/open-source-typefaces)

2. Choose ONE catchy colour, dark enough to provide **contrast** as a background. You can browse them on [Coloors](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending).  
3. Make/Find two fancy *noise gradient backgrounds*. Make one white, one black and one coloured, with the same pattern.

4. Voilà: you’re ready to make a clean pitch deck to raise 80 thousand bajillions of dollars.

## Informal Documents

Google Docs is absolutely okay for these. I created a Markdown Formatted preset [right here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14f2e3mRNGZvZmaZyUypNv_SY-gpKqD_VEjtFzV5zISY/edit?usp=sharing)\!

## Anything Else

I have often used [Whimsical](http://whimsical.com) to make cute infographics. Results are neat but exporting images leads to having a watermark in the bottom right corner.

Another nice piece of software is [Miro](https://miro.com/).

For software diagrams: [Diagrams.net.](http://Diagrams.net) No stylish aesthetics but you get what you pay for.
